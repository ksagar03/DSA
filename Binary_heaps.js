<b>It is a type of Tree</b>
In heaps also we have so many types 
<br/>for more information check this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures">link</a> 
<h2>Binary heaps</h2>
It is similar to binary search tree but the only change is the rules of arranging the nodes
<br/>
there are two types of binary heaps
<li>MaxBinaryHeap</li>
<li>MinBinaryHeap</li>
In <b>MaxBinaryHeap</b> the parent Node should be more that the Child Node(note: there is no restriction in placing the child nodes)
Eg: In the below example as we can see "25" is more than "19" but this a valid Maxbinaryheap as the rule is applied only to the respective parent and child nodes it has no link with the other parent node

<br/>
In <b>MinBinaryHeap</b> it is Vise versa child nodes should be more than the parent node 
eg: 
<img class="image" src="images/MinBinaryHeap.png"/>
<br/>
<b>Binary heap Most commonlly used used to implement <u>priority Queues</u> </b>
also Binary heaps are used in graphs traversal
